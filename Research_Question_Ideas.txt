Possible Research Questions

Q1.
To what extent can a layered, questionnaire-driven framework combined with a Large Language Model support semi-automated threat modeling during the early stages of system design?

Q2.
Can Large Language Models generate structurally valid and security-relevant Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) based solely on structured, non-code system descriptions?

Q3.
How consistent and repeatable are LLM-generated threat modeling outputs when the same system is described using the same structured questionnaire?

Q4.
How effectively can an LLM-assisted threat modeling approach identify potential security threats (e.g., STRIDE categories) without access to implementation-level details?

Q5.
To what degree does a structured, LLM-guided questionnaire reduce dependency on security expertise in the threat modeling process?

Q6.
Which aspects of threat modeling (e.g., trust boundaries, data flows, threat categorization) benefit most from LLM assistance, and which still require human expert intervention?

Q7.
What are the limitations and risks of using Large Language Models for automated or semi-automated threat modeling in security-sensitive system designs?
